ECG-Signals-and-Spectrograms


::General Information::

At the main directory, there are two jupyter notebooks, of which one is showing the complete implemenation code for Spectrograms data and the other is showing the same code but for implementation of Raw ECG signals data. We showed the output of each code part inside the each notebook.

There is another folder named as Graph, which consists of jupyter notebook that is showing the various graphs (alongwith code) which we used in our study.

One more folder is sampling rate, which consists of 08 jupyter notebooks and each of which is named to the particular sample rate along with implemenation code in python programming language.


::How to run the code?:: 

Please follow the below steps:

Step 1: upload/open the jupyter notebook in any environment i.e., Google Colab, Jupyter Lab

Step 2: Prepare the data repository (i.e., your own) in the similar format as given below:

---dataset-colab (This is the main folder, you may rename it)

-------> Train

------------> Class I data

------------> Class II data

-------Validate

------------ Class I data

------------ Class II data

(Hint: Please check once the Train and Validate data path and verify it's correct for you)

Step 3: Execute the jupyter notebook at once or step by step using the play button and you will see the results of each code part inside the jupyter notebook.

(Hint: You may see some additional codes regarding the memory utilization which maybe not interested for as a part of classification and you may skip this part. It will not effect your classification task).

Thank you

Good Luck!!!
